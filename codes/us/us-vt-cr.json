  "description": "This entry was imported from the Open Corporates Jurisdiction List.In July 2014 Vermont changed their company register from http://www.sec.state.vt.us/corps/corp.htm to https://www.sec.state.vt.us/corporationsbusiness-services/searches-databases.aspx - coinciding with this was a change to the numbering system for companies in Vermont. Company numbers have been migrated to use the new system and old links will redirect to these new company numbers.
