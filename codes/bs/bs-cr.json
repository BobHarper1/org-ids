  "description": "This entry was imported from the Open Corporates Jurisdiction List.Bahamas public company identifiers are not unique - specifically early company numbers are frequently duplicates, with different companies of different types having the same number. Because of that, OpenCorporates uses the company number with a company type suffix, based on the type code mapping on the register's website, which we believe to be unique.",
