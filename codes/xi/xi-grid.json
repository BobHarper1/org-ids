  "description": "The Global Research Identifiers Database collects information on research institutions and assigns them a unique identifier.\n\nIt draws on information from funding datasets, and claims over 90% coverage of institutions. \n\nIt records information on the nature of the research organisation, covering companies, education establishments, healthcare, non-profits, government and other entity types. \n\nGRID also records parent-child relationships between entities, and 'related relationships' for cross-linkages. \n\nIt includes cross-linkages to a range of other identifier sources.
